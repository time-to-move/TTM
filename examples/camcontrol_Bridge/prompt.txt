A stone bridge arches over a narrow river winding through a steep canyon. The camera flies low along the river, gliding beneath the bridge, where water sparkles and echoes against the rock walls. Slowly, the view rises upward, revealing vast green forests blanketing the surrounding hills and valleys. Warm sunlight filters through the trees, highlighting the lush textures of the landscape and adding depth to the sweeping forest view.
