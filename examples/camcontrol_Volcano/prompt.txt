Under a starry night sky illuminated by the ethereal glow of the aurora borealis, a volcano erupts with fierce intensity. Molten lava spews high into the air, casting a fiery orange glow against the darkened landscape. The lava cascades down the sides of the volcano, forming glowing rivers that snake across the rugged terrain. Ash and smoke billow upwards, mingling with the vibrant colors of the northern lights, creating a dramatic and mesmerizing spectacle. The scene is both awe-inspiring and formidable, capturing the raw power and beauty of nature in its most elemental form.
