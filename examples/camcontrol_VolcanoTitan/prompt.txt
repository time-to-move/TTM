A colossal titan emerges from the molten heart of an erupting volcano, its body composed of dark, jagged rock with glowing veins of fiery lava. Lightning crackles across the stormy sky, illuminating the titan's menacing form as it rises with a slow, deliberate motion. Rivers of lava cascade down the volcano's slopes, carving fiery paths through the landscape. The titan's eyes burn with an intense, molten glow, and its massive hands grip the edges of the lava pool, sending tremors through the ground. As the eruption intensifies, the titan lets out a thunderous roar, echoing across the volcanic terrain.
