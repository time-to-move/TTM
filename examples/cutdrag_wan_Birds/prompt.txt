As the sun sets, casting a warm glow across the sky, three birds glide gracefully through the air. A majestic eagle leads the way, its powerful wings outstretched, catching the last rays of sunlight. Beside it, a swift falcon darts with precision, its sleek form cutting through the gentle breeze. Below them, a swallow flits playfully, its agile movements creating a dance against the backdrop of rolling hills and silhouetted trees. The scene is serene, with the birds moving in harmony, painting a picture of freedom and grace against the vibrant hues of the evening sky.
